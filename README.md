## Whitelisting_Project_GoerliNet :-
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, 
a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

## my-app 
This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.
First, run the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev 

```
## " Whitelisting "
 Whitelist is a list of registered and approved participants that are given exclusive access to contribute to an initial coin offering
 (ICO) or a presale.Crypto projects can  open whitelist so that they can collect funds for their project by selling their project’s token t
 o the whitelisted addresses. And later, after deploying the project to the public…that whitelisted addresses can sell their token at a high
 price to the public.
 Whitelisting also allows NFT projects to reward early supporters with guaranteed slots for them to mint an NFT (or multiple NFTs 
 depending on the whitelisting/project rules).

So this whitelisting is for 
* Raising fund to initial projects
* Earning source for the investors (whitelisted addresses )

Track down all whitelisted addresses :--->
